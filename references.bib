	abstract = {This article discusses the 'non-traditional music' ({NTM}) student in secondary education in the United States as a unique population of students who are 'non-participants' in traditional music ensembles. Through the use of current music technology, teachers are offering technology-based
music classes ({TBMCs}) and are successfully engaging {NTM} students in performing, recording and composing. Eight attributes are proposed to characterize {NTMs}. An estimate of the non-participant music population and the validity of the proposed {NTM} attributes are examined through an analysis
of anecdotal and empirical data from several extant studies. The results suggest that these attributes reasonably describe {NTMs} with some modification. {NTMs} are in the sixth through twelfth grades, do not typically participate in traditional performing ensembles, and most likely do not read
standard music notation. More than 67 per cent of these students may play an instrument or sing, 28 per cent have an active music life outside of school, and many aspire to a career in music industry or performance. There is also evidence that {TBMCs} are motivationally beneficial to academic-
and discipline-challenged students. Revisions to the set of attributes for {NTMs} are offered and suggestions for future research are proposed with special attention to parallels in music programmes internationally.},

The use of technology in music education is gaining momentum, although very little work has focused on students with disabilities. Our {SoundScape} programme addressed this gap through implementing a technology-based music programme for adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorders ({ASD}). Programme participants met on a weekly basis for 9 weeks and engaged in a range of music-related activities mostly utilising touch screen technology and {iPads}. We were particularly interested in how those with {ASD} responded to the {iPad} interface and its impact on social interactions among participants. We also investigated whether participating in the programme reduced stress and anxiety among participants. Questionnaire data completed by programme participants at the beginning and end of the programme, as well as qualitative analysis of focus groups conducted with parents, provided evaluation of the efficacy of our programme model. Findings from the questionnaires indicated that more than half of the participants reported feeling less stressed and anxious at the end of the programme compared to their responses at the beginning, said they benefited socially from the programme, and had made friends. This was supported in the analysis of the focus group transcriptions which highlighted the advantages of the {iPads} compared to a more traditional desktop platform, the utility of the {iPad} technology for promoting social skills, the significance of the university setting, and the participants’ use of music to regulate mood. Future research evaluating the use of technology in music education for students with disabilities seems warranted.},

	abstract = {This study was an investigation of middle and high school students’ preferences for various music learning conditions and secondary music course offerings. The stratified random sample included students who were and were not enrolled in school music classes ( N = 827). Participants represented secondary school music students ( n = 369), students who only participate in music outside of school ( n = 254), and nonparticipants in music ( n = 204). The research questions for this study concerned students’ preferences for teacher role, group size, and repertoire in the music classroom as well as interest in six different secondary music courses. Findings showed out-of-school music participants and nonparticipants had a stronger preference for small group learning environments and repertoire choice when compared to school music participants. In-school and out-of-school music participants expressed similar levels of interest in four music course offerings and ranked them as follows: (1) piano/guitar class, (2) music composition with technology class, (3) popular music groups, and (4) music history/theory class. In-school and out-of-school music participants differed on only two course offerings: large ensembles and world music groups. In-school music participants expressed high interest in large ensembles, whereas out-of-school music participants conveyed a lower interest in large ensembles.},

	abstract = {In the current era of technology, artificial intelligence has grown rapidly in such a way that it has established its presence in all fields. The purpose of artificial intelligence is to reduce human intervention and complete tasks with an enhanced result. In this research, we are going to study the application of artificial intelligence technology in art teaching, taking architectural painting as an example. Architectural painting is a type of painting that focuses only on architecture, including indoor and outdoor views of the buildings. In earlier stages, architecture was shown only in the background of paintings that had different objects as the main subject. Later, architecture itself became a mainstream genre in the field of painting. As has been shown by other researchers, the latest technologies such as Internet technology, wireless sensor networks ({WSNs}), and artificial intelligence like deep learning technologies are deployed in art teaching. Artificial intelligence has made teaching easier. This proposed system makes use of Internet technology, {WSNs}, artificial intelligence, and lightweight deep learning models in the field of art teaching. The teaching method is enhanced by adapting to this new technology. For performing the analysis of the proposed system, the Limited Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (L-{BFGS}) art algorithm is implemented. This L-{BFGS} algorithm focuses on finding the local minima in any given application. In this art teaching of architectural painting, the proposed algorithm will aid in explaining the minute works to be noted while doing the artwork. The proposed algorithm is then compared with the traditional Gradient Descent, Adam, and Adadelta algorithms. From the results, it can be observed that the proposed algorithm has achieved accuracy of 97\% and 98\% in the training and testing phases, respectively.},
